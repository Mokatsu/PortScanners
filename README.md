# PortScanners

I started this project to learn python programming and networking basics. This repository includes all my earlier works when I was learning how to use the scapy module.

The final product is a port scanner (portScanner.py) that uses python's multiprocessing module to increase the speed at which multiple ports can be scanned. It is a command line interface that lets you selects the Target Host, Protocol, and the flag to determine what type of scan it will perform.

I know that this program does not stand a change with nmap/zenmap, but it did provide me with an understanding of what the actual scan type does to determine if a port is opened/filtered/closed. 

Usage:
sudo python [program name] [flags]
